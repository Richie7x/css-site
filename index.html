          <h3>1000+ Hours With Sabine.</h3>
          <p>I've spent tremendous amount of my gameplay time simping on Delilah Sabine a.k.a Viper from Valorant. Thus, I've attained mastery level of playing with this beautiful agent and I can adapt to any situation while playing with her making me capable of outplaying other powerful agents and duelists without any hassle. This experience made me realize that she'll always be the most cracked agent in the entire Valorant roster.</p>

          <h3>Head Tapping Capability.</h3>
          <p>Thankfully, I am capable of successfully tapping heads and reacting, adapting to various situations in Valorant. I've mastered controlling some underrated weapons and agents, involving my patient and IQ plays to overturn the situation with Viper. In addition, I can camp real hard almost being invisible to enemy eyes.</p>

          <h3>Adaptability.</h3>
          <p>Valorant is just one among the never ending list. I've spend a formidable amount of my life playing different Videogames which finally made me being adaptable to any Videoagme with only a few hours of gameplay. Moreover, I'm infamously known for withstanding the pressure and finishing AAA games (along with side stories and quests) within a few short hours or in less than three days time at max.</p>
